# Diploma Thesis LaTex-Template

Since there is no template for the Diploma Thesis in .Tex format, i decided to write one, in order to learn more about LaTeX.

I used VS Code and the given Word files for the whole project. In addition to that, LuaLaTeX is used for this project, because normal LaTeX cannot use Arial font, which is mandatory. To enable the lualatex as default, you have to run your code with the lualatex compiler as visible in the picture below.

Subsequently go to the extension setting and serach for "lastused", change from "first" to "lastUsed" and you can compile with the normal run button or (Ctrl+Alt+B).

Installing everything necessary:

Firstly we need VS Code, here is the install Link: https://code.visualstudio.com/Download
In VS Code you can install the extention LaTeX Workstation.

Next, a form of TeX needed to be installed. I personally used Tex Live, but MikTeX can solve problems, if you have a blank in your latex path. The download and installation is pretty straight forward, just follow the link provided.
https://latex.tugraz.at/programme/tex_live While installing, please make sure to deactivate all antivirus programms, otherwise the installer wont find a mirror.

After installing use the link provided to enable TeX in VS Code

For a gold foil print on the book cover use the template on sharepoint. Yes, there actually exists one....
