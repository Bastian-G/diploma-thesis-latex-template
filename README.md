# Diploma Thesis LaTex-Template

Since there is no template for the Diploma Thesis in .Tex format, i decided to write one, in order to learn more about LaTeX.

I used VS Code and the given Word files for the whole project. In addition to that, LuaLaTeX is used for this project, because normal LaTeX cannot use Arial font, which is mandatory.

Installing everything necessary:

Firstly we need VS Code, here is the install Link: https://code.visualstudio.com/Download
In VS Code you can install the extention LaTeX Workstation.

Subsequently, a form of TeX needed to be installed. I personally used Tex Live. The download and installation is pretty straight forward, just follow the link provided.

After installing use the link provided to enable TeX in VS Code
